# Welcome to the Blackheap Documentation [(Click here)]()

This does not contain the HTML version of docstrings. Instead, it explains the core concepts behind iofs.

This book was made with [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).

## Build docs

You need to have rust installed. If in doubt, use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for version management.

First, install mdbook:
```
cargo install mdbook
```

After that, build the mdbook with
```
mdbook build
```

or start a liveserver with

```
mdbook serve --open
```
