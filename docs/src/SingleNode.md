# Local Single Node Setup

---
blabla
- [x] run benchmark
  - [x] same partition / device
- [ ] analyze benchmark via TS/React
- [ ] calculate data against benchmark
  - [ ] explain `LD_PRELOAD`
  - [ ] link to file format

- Single node setup allows for local classification of I/O requests
- no server or database required
- no changes to the binary or workflow are required

## Creating a performance model
- TODO THIS CAN ALSO BE USED FOR THE GLOBAL DOCS
- After compiling, the performance model can be generated by just running `blackheap`
- One should run the benchmarks on the same partition / device as the program which one wants to analyze
  obviously in order to match the characteristics
  This can be specified via the `--to` parameter, see `blackheap --help` for more

## Analyzing the created model
- Afterwards, a model folder will be created.
  - The default path is `$PWD/default-model`

- In this folder, the single file web-frontend is contained named `index.html`.
- This can be viewed on any device with any modern browser
-

## Using the created model locally
