# Workflow

## Overview

The workflow can be broken down into 3 components:

- [Generating performance measurements via different benchmarks](./Benchmark.md)
- [Analyzing the benchmarks](./Analysis.md)
- [Creating a predictive performance model based on the single analyses](./ModelCreation.md)

Note that Blackheap does all of those 3 steps automatically, no manual work is required!
